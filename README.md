## Nuancias

Nuancias is a publishing platform that I developed to practice Clean Architecture for the first time. 

## Project structure

 - `pages/`: Folder dedicated for the Next.JS framework where which file is a page;
 - `public/`: Assets folder;
 - `cypress`: End-to-end tests folder;
 - `src/`: Source code with clean architecture.
